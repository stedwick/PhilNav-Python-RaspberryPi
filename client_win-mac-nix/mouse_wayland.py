# Prompt: I'm making a virtual mouse in Python, and I have implementations for Windows, Mac, and Linux X11, see attached files. Linux is moving to Wayland which doesn't support X11 protocols to move the mouse, so I want to write an implementation using python-uinput. See https://pypi.org/project/python-uinput/ and https://github.com/pyinput/python-uinput.

# Create a setCursorPos function for me using /dev/uinput thanks!

# I'll help you create a Wayland implementation using python-uinput. Note that using uinput requires root privileges or adding the user to the input group.
# Here's the implementation for mouse_wayland.py:

# A few important notes about this implementation:
# This requires root privileges or the user needs to be in the input group
# You'll need to install python-uinput (pip install python-uinput) and the system package (sudo apt-get install python3-uinput on Ubuntu/Debian)
# The implementation uses relative movements since uinput doesn't support absolute positioning
# Position tracking might get out of sync with the actual cursor position since we can't read the true position
# The time.sleep() is added to ensure events are processed properly
# To use this on a Linux system with Wayland, you'll need to:
# Install the requirements: sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
# Add your user to the input group: sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
# Load the uinput kernel module: sudo modprobe uinput
# You might want to add error handling and initialization checks to make sure the uinput device is available and properly set up.
